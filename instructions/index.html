        <h1>Creating your own</h1>
		
		<ol>
		<li>Create a file in Google Drive and place all your <a href="#LocationListFormat">map locations</a> into it.</li>
		<li>Set the file's visibility to "<a href="#GoogleDriveVisibility">Public on the web</a>" then add <a href="#GoogleDriveId">its id</a> to the end of this URL:<br/>
			<pre>https://googledrive.com/host/0B35KCzsTLKY1bXBnOGdSR0V0ZUU/index.html?googlesrc=</pre>
		</li>
		<li>You're done!</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2>In more detail...</h2>
		<p>To create your own map you take the web-address of the map page and add your own settings to the end of the URL. One of 
		the settings you add is the web-address of a page containing all the locations you want displayed on your map.</p>
		
		<p>If you're going to collaboratively build the map with others, then a shared editable file on Google Drive or a wiki page are good 
		places to keep the list of locations - that way everyone can edit the list and the map page can read the locations directly from it. 
		The locations list can be in either html format or txt format.</p>
		
        <p>If you want to host it yourself, then download the zip file on the right, otherwise just use the one already hosted on 
		Google Drive. For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy">security reasons</a>, browsers won't allow 
		the map page to access your locations list unless both their addresses share the same domain, so...</p> 
		<p class="highlight">this means <span style="font-weight: bold;">if you don't want to host the map page yourself, and want to use the one already on Google Drive, 
		then you must also create you locations list on Google Drive.</span></p>
		
		
		<h2><a id="GoogleDriveId"></a>Getting the id of a file on Google Drive</h2>		
		Upload your file to Google Drive, then click on it and

		<h1><a id="LocationListFormat"></a>Location list format</h1>
		
		
		<p style="color: red"><a href="">An example location-list file</a></p>
		
		<p>The Location list file is a list of locations, one per line. Each line gives a location type and its Minecraft x and z coordinates. You can use F3 in Minecraft to get coordinates.</p>
		
		<p>If your location list file is a text file, then the filename must end in either <code>.txt</code> or <code>.csv</code>, and locations are specified in comma separated format. For example the following is a csv locations list:</p>
        <div class="highlight">
		<pre>type,             x,     z,    description,                      owner,       href, icon-index

DesertVillage,  245,   350, "Ghost town" 	
WitchHut,     -4056, -2487,
PlayerHouse,   -800, -1800, "RedstoneRising's mountain lair", "RedstoneRising", "", 21</pre>
        </div>		
		
		
		<p>If the location list is an html file (for example a wiki page), then the locations can be specified either with 
		unordered "bullet" lists, e.g:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>DesertVillage,  245,   350, "Ghost town"</li>
		<li>WitchHut,     -2056, -2487</li>
		<li>PlayerHouse,   -800, -1800, "RedstoneRising's mountain lair", "RedstoneRising", "", 21</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>or by using a table:</p>

		<p><TABLE BORDER='1'>
		<TR><TD COLSPAN="1"><strong>Type</strong></TD><TD COLSPAN="1"> x    </TD><TD COLSPAN="1">  z    </TD><TD COLSPAN="1"><strong>Description</strong></TD><TD COLSPAN="1"><strong>Owner</strong></TD><TD COLSPAN="1"><strong>href</strong></TD><TD COLSPAN="1"><strong>IconIndex</strong> </TD></TR>
		<TR><TD colspan='1'> DesertVillage        </TD><TD COLSPAN="1">1245 </TD><TD COLSPAN="1"> 350 </TD><TD COLSPAN="1">Ghost town</TD><TD COLSPAN="1">  </TD><TD COLSPAN="1">  </TD><TD COLSPAN="1">  </TD></TR>
		<TR><TD colspan='1'> WitchHut        </TD><TD COLSPAN="1">-2056 </TD><TD COLSPAN="1"> -2487 </TD><TD COLSPAN="1"></TD><TD COLSPAN="1">  </TD><TD COLSPAN="1">  </TD><TD COLSPAN="1">  </TD></TR>
		<TR><TD colspan='1'> PlayerHouse        </TD><TD COLSPAN="1">-400 </TD><TD COLSPAN="1"> -1800 </TD><TD COLSPAN="1">RedstoneRising's mountain lair</TD><TD COLSPAN="1">RedstoneRising</TD><TD COLSPAN="1">  </TD><TD COLSPAN="1">21</TD></TR>
		</TABLE></p>
		
		<p>Or with a combination of bullet lists and tables. Because of the examples above, even this page would work as a location list!</p>
		
		<p><a href="#Settings">Settings</a> for the map, such as <span class="setting">range</span> can also be specified in your location list file.</p>
		
		<h2>Locations</h2>
		
		Each location may have up to 7 columns (or comma seperated values) of information specified:
			<blockquote>type, x, z, description, owner, href, icon-index</blockquote>
			
		but only the first 3 items are required (type, x, z).
		
		<h3>type</h3>
		<p>The first column specifies the type of location, and must be one of the following: </p>

		<ul>
		<li><span class="locationtype">Spawn</span></li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">PlayerHouse</span></li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">PlayerCastle</span></li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">PlayerStructure</span> - a generic catch-all block for things players have built that defy any more specific icons.</li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">EnchantingRoom</span></li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">Village</span></li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">DesertVillage</span></li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">JungleTemple</span></li>   
		<li><span class="locationtype">DesertTemple</span></li> 
		<li><span class="locationtype">WitchHut</span></li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">NetherFortress</span></li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">NetherPortal</span></li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">Forest</span></li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">MushroomIsland</span></li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">Horse</span></li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">Wolf</span></li>      
		<li><span class="locationtype">Dragon</span> - a dragon. You can use it to indicate an End portal, the Ender Dragon, or just as "Here be dragons" filler decoration.</li>       
		<li><span class="locationtype">Label</span> - a location-type that has no icon by default, you can use it to place plain text onto the map.</li>     
		</ul>
  
		<p>The location-type determines the default icon to be drawn at the location, and some have a default
		href (for example, <span class="locationtype">Village</span> icons link to <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Village">http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Village</a> by default). 
		However both the icon and the href of a location-type can be overridden by placing your own values in the appropriate columns.
		</p>
		
		<p>Given that any location-type can be set to display any icon or href, their purpose is only to make the list easier to read, and to 
		save having to repeatedly type out the details.</p>
		
		<h3>x and z</h3>

		<p>The x and z columns should contain the area's coordinates from Minecraft (press F3 in the game to see your coordinates).</p>
		
		<h3>description and owner</h3>
		
		<p>Description and owner are optional and determine how the map location will be labelled. They don't need to be inside double-quotation marks (") but putting them in quotemarks allows the following:
			<ul> 
			<li>You can insert a \n in your text if you want to split the line.</li>
			<li>You can add spaces to pad out the start or end of your label if you want to nudge its position slightly 
			to avoid something else on the map nearby. <br/>
			<span class="note">(Note that html collapses multiple spaces into one, so in a wiki you'd 
			have to type out the code &amp;nbsp; lots of times instead of just hitting the spacebar)</span></li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		

		<h3>icon-index</h3>
		
		<p>There are more icons available than can be specified with the location-type. The icon-index field lets you 
		manually choose the icon to be displayed at the location. The stock icons and their icon-index can be viewed in this 
		<a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B35KCzsTLKY1bXBnOGdSR0V0ZUU/index.html?src=legend.csv">Legend Map</a>. 
		You can also <a href="#Settings_icons">add your own</a>.</p>

		<p>You'll notice two styles of icons, some are in Minecraft style and others are in the hand-drawn fantasy map style, 
		the idea was to give the impression of Minecraft structures on a fantasy map.</p>
		
		<br/>
		
		<h1><a id="Settings"></a>Settings</h1>
		
		<p>Map settings such as <span class="setting">range</span> can be specified either in the location-list file, or 
		in the map URL. Settings in the URL will override settings in the location-list file, allowing the creation of different URLs
		for different views of the same location list.</p>
		
		<p>Settings take the from of <code>key=value</code>. Settings must have one line each when in a location-list file, but
		are all on the same line when specified in a URL - separated by "&amp;" symbols.</p>
		
		When string values are specified in a setting in a URL, you should <a href="UrlEncoder.html">encode the value</a> first, to ensure
		the URL remains valid.
		
		<p>The following settings are available:
		
		
		
		
		</p>
		
		<h3><a id="Settings_icons"></a>icons</h3>

		<p>If you want to make your own icons you can place them in a <code>.png</code> file, make the <code>.png</code> file available from the same location as the location list 
		file, and use the <span class="setting">icons</span> setting to add them to the list of icons (their icon-indexes will begin at 32).</p>
		
		Icons are square and all icons in a file are the same size, the <code>.png</code> file should be twice the height of the icons (to allow room for the icon and it background). 
		You specify the height of your icons via the height of the .png file, see the <code>iconguide.png</code> file.
		
		
		
		<h1>Philosophy</h1>
		<p>Extra features can make the map easier, such displaying coordinate locations, and perhaps this will happen in a later version or fork. However
		the original idea behind this map was to preserve Minecraft's world-exploration gameplay. It's intended to be like ye olde fantasy-genre map - having to work out where you are, what direction you face and what
		direction to head, more of a guide really. Put on your adventurer's cap.</p>
				
		<p>It was made for our no-cheats/shortcuts survival server. <a href="http://overviewer.org">Overviewer</a> already caters nicely for the opposite philosophy.</p>
