		<h2>In more detail...</h2>
		<p>It also <a href="dropbox.html">works from your Dropbox</a>, or a wiki page.</p>
		
		<p>To create your own map you take the URL of the map page and add your own settings to the end of it. One of 
		the settings you add is the URL of a page containing all the locations you want displayed on your map (or a Google Drive ID).</p>
		
		<p>If you're going to collaboratively build the map with others, then a shared editable file on Google Drive or a wiki page are good 
		places to keep the list of locations - that way everyone can edit the list and the map page can read the locations directly from it. 
		The locations list can be in either html format or txt format. By default, Google Drive will view but not edit .txt files, you can 
		change this by adding a notepad app - go to Options &rarr; Manage apps.</p>

		<h1><a id="LocationListFormat"></a>Location list format</h1>
		
		
		<p style="color: red"><a href="">An example location-list file</a></p>
		
		<p>The Location list file is a list of locations, one per line. Each line gives a location type and its Minecraft x and z coordinates. You can use F3 in Minecraft to get coordinates.</p>
		
		<p>If your location list file is a text file, then the filename must end in either <code>.txt</code> or <code>.csv</code>, and locations are specified in comma separated format. For example the following is a csv locations list:</p>
        <div class="highlight">
		<pre>type,             x,     z,    description,                      owner,       href, icon-index

DesertVillage,  245,   350, "Ghost town" 	
WitchHut,     -4056, -2487,
PlayerHouse,   -800, -1800, "RedstoneRising's mountain lair", "RedstoneRising", "", 21</pre>
        </div>		
		
		
		<p>If the location list is an html file (for example a wiki page), then the locations can be specified either with 
		unordered "bullet" lists, e.g:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>DesertVillage,  245,   350, "Ghost town"</li>
		<li>WitchHut,     -2056, -2487</li>
		<li>PlayerHouse,   -800, -1800, "RedstoneRising's mountain lair", "RedstoneRising", "", 21</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>or by using a table:</p>

		<p><TABLE BORDER='1'>
		<TR><TD COLSPAN="1"><strong>Type</strong></TD><TD COLSPAN="1"> x    </TD><TD COLSPAN="1">  z    </TD><TD COLSPAN="1"><strong>Description</strong></TD><TD COLSPAN="1"><strong>Owner</strong></TD><TD COLSPAN="1"><strong>href</strong></TD><TD COLSPAN="1"><strong>IconIndex</strong> </TD></TR>
		<TR><TD colspan='1'> DesertVillage        </TD><TD COLSPAN="1">1245 </TD><TD COLSPAN="1"> 350 </TD><TD COLSPAN="1">Ghost town</TD><TD COLSPAN="1">  </TD><TD COLSPAN="1">  </TD><TD COLSPAN="1">  </TD></TR>
		<TR><TD colspan='1'> WitchHut        </TD><TD COLSPAN="1">-2056 </TD><TD COLSPAN="1"> -2487 </TD><TD COLSPAN="1"></TD><TD COLSPAN="1">  </TD><TD COLSPAN="1">  </TD><TD COLSPAN="1">  </TD></TR>
		<TR><TD colspan='1'> PlayerHouse        </TD><TD COLSPAN="1">-400 </TD><TD COLSPAN="1"> -1800 </TD><TD COLSPAN="1">RedstoneRising's mountain lair</TD><TD COLSPAN="1">RedstoneRising</TD><TD COLSPAN="1">  </TD><TD COLSPAN="1">21</TD></TR>
		</TABLE></p>
		
		<p>Or with a combination of bullet lists and tables. Because of the examples above, even this page would work as a location list!</p>
		
		<p><a href="#Settings">Settings</a> for the map, such as <span class="setting">range</span> can also be specified in your location list file.</p>
		
		<h2>Locations</h2>
		
		Each location may have up to 7 columns (or comma seperated values) of information specified:
			<blockquote>type, x, z, description, owner, href, icon-index</blockquote>
			
		but only the first 3 items are required (type, x, z).
		
		<h3>type</h3>
		<p>The first column specifies the type of location, and must be one of the following: </p>

		<ul>
		<li><span class="locationtype">Spawn</span></li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">PlayerHouse</span></li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">PlayerCastle</span></li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">PlayerStructure</span> - a generic catch-all block for things players have built that defy any more specific icons.</li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">EnchantingRoom</span></li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">Village</span></li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">DesertVillage</span></li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">SavannahVillage</span></li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">JungleTemple</span></li>   
		<li><span class="locationtype">DesertTemple</span></li> 
		<li><span class="locationtype">WitchHut</span></li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">NetherFortress</span></li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">NetherPortal</span></li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">Forest</span></li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">FlowerForest</span></li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">MushroomIsland</span></li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">Horse</span></li>
		<li><span class="locationtype">Wolf</span></li>      
		<li><span class="locationtype">Dragon</span> - a dragon. You can use it to indicate an End portal, the Ender Dragon, or just as "Here be dragons" filler decoration.</li>       
		<li><span class="locationtype">Label</span> - a location-type that has no icon by default, you can use it to place plain text onto the map.</li>     
		</ul>
  
		<p>The location-type determines the default icon to be drawn at the location, and some have a default
		href (for example, <span class="locationtype">Village</span> icons link to <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Village">http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Village</a> by default). 
		However both the icon and the href of a location-type can be overridden by placing your own values in the appropriate columns.
		</p>
		
		<p>Given that any location-type can be set to display any icon or href, their purpose is only to make the list easier to read, and to 
		save having to repeatedly type out the details.</p>
		
		<h3>x and z</h3>

		<p>The x and z columns should contain the area's coordinates from Minecraft (press F3 in the game to see your coordinates).</p>
		
		<h3>description and owner</h3>
		
		<p>Description and owner are optional and determine how the map location will be labelled. They don't need to be inside double-quotation marks (") but putting them in quotemarks allows the following:
			<ul> 
			<li>You can insert a \n in your text if you want to split the line.</li>
			<li>You can add spaces to pad out the start or end of your label if you want to nudge its position slightly 
			to avoid something else on the map nearby. <br/>
			<span class="note">(Note that html collapses multiple spaces into one, so in a wiki you'd 
			have to type out the code &amp;nbsp; lots of times instead of just hitting the spacebar)</span></li>
			<li>You can use quotation marks inside a label when it's surrounded by quotation marks. Do this by placing two in a row, for 
			example <code>"My ""Scare quotes"""</code> will be drawn as <code>My "Scare quotes"</code>.<br/>
			<span class="note">(Note that quotation marks cannot be used in a label unless it's surrounded with quotation 
			marks)</span></li>
			<li>You can also use commas inside a label when it's surrounded by quotation marks.</li>
			</ul>					
		</p>
		
		<p>If a value for owner is provided, and it doesn't already occur within the description, then the owner's name will be
		placed in parenthesis underneath the label.</p>
		

		<h3>icon-index</h3>
		
		<p>There are more icons available than can be specified with the location-type. The icon-index field lets you 
		manually choose the icon to be displayed at the location. The stock icons and their icon-index can be viewed in this 
		<a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B35KCzsTLKY1bXBnOGdSR0V0ZUU/index.html?src=legend.csv">Legend Map</a>. 
		You can also <a href="#Settings_icons">add your own</a>.</p>

		<p>You'll notice two styles of icons, some are in Minecraft style and others are in the hand-drawn fantasy map style, 
		the idea was to give the impression of Minecraft structures on a fantasy map.</p>
		
		<br/>
		
		<h1><a id="Settings"></a>Settings</h1>
		
		<p>Map settings such as <span class="setting">range</span> can be specified either in the location-list file, or 
		in the map URL. Settings in the URL will override settings in the location-list file, allowing the creation of different URLs
		for different views of the same location list.</p>
		
		<p>Settings take the from of <code>key=value</code>. Settings must have one line each when in a location-list file, but
		are all on the same line when specified in a URL - separated by "&amp;" symbols.</p>
		
		When string values are specified in a setting in a URL, you should <a href="UrlEncoder.html">encode the value</a> first, to ensure
		the URL remains valid.
		
		<p>The following settings are available:
		
		
		
		
		</p>
		
		<h3><a id="Settings_icons"></a>icons</h3>

		<p>If you want to make your own icons you can place them in a <code>.png</code> file, make the <code>.png</code> file available from the same location as the location list 
		file, and use the <span class="setting">icons</span> setting to add them to the list of icons (their icon-indexes will begin at 32).</p>
		
		Icons are square and all icons in a file are the same size, the <code>.png</code> file should be twice the height of the icons (to allow room for the icon and it background). 
		You specify the height of your icons via the height of the .png file, see the <code>iconguide.png</code> file.
		
		<h1>Tips</h1>
		you can use the paper texture to estimate distance, as the distance scale is aligned with it.
		
		make range divisible by 32 for round numbers on the scale		
		
		Controlling captions
		  - add newlines to caption large images
		  - supressed captions
		  - aligning captions with linebreaks and spaces
		  - labellevels and smartlabels.
		  
		Use a text editor
		
		<h1>Philosophy</h1>
		<p>Extra features can make the map easier, such displaying coordinates, and perhaps this will happen in a later version or fork. However
		the original idea behind this map was to preserve Minecraft's world-exploration gameplay. It's intended to be like ye olde fantasy-genre map - having to work out where you are, what direction you face and what
		direction to head, more of a guide really. Put on your adventurer's cap.</p>
				
		<p>It was made for our no-cheats/shortcuts survival server. <a href="http://overviewer.org">Overviewer</a> already caters nicely for the opposite philosophy.</p>
		
		What it really needs is a nice web-UI for people to enter their locations in with.
