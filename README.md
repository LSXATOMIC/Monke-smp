minecraft-map
=============

online map for smp Minecraft servers that don't want to spoil the need to explore.

To use it you specify variables on its URL, and perhaps use an URL-shortening service to fix the variables in place

The following variables are supported
* src          - the url of the locations (either txt or html files), see locationsdemo.csv
* range        - the radius of the map in minecraft blocks (defaults to 6000)
* labelslevel  - the zoom level to show labels at (0 means all, 3 means none)
* icons        - optional url for custom icons (locations with an iconindex of 16 or more)
* title        - change the title of the page
* blurb        - change the text of the page
